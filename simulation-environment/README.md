This directory contains all configuration needed to containerize the simulation environment in Docker

## To start simulation
1. Start the Docker daemon (easiest to just open Docker desktop app)
2. Run `docker compose build` in your terminal to build the image for the vulnerable program
3. Run `docker compose up` in your terminal to start the container
4. Look for the running container environment in Docker Desktop
